# ScheduleScript
Gives me my daily schedule hosted on a web server 


This is hosted on an apache web server. 
It pulls the current day of the week then gives me the
task that I need to complete for that day.
Everything can be changed in the schedule.txt file so there
is no need to change the actual code.
